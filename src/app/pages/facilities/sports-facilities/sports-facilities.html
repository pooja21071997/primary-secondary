              The school strongly believes in the importance of sports for students’ overall
              development. Sports help maintain physical fitness, boost mental agility, and build
              emotional strength. To support this, the school offers excellent facilities, including
              a large football ground, two volleyball courts, two kho-kho grounds, a cricket ground,
              and a multipurpose basketball court.

              These spaces help students develop teamwork, leadership, discipline, and
              sportsmanship. Regular participation in sports also improves focus and academic
              performance. Through these activities, the school nurtures well-rounded individuals
              who are physically active, mentally sharp, and emotionally balanced.
