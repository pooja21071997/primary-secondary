          The school strongly believes in the importance of sports for students'[] overall
          development. Sports help maintain physical fitness, boost mental agility, and build
          emotional strength. To support this, the school offers excellent facilities, including a
          large football ground, two volleyball courts, two kho-kho grounds, a cricket ground, and a
          multipurpose basketball court.

          these activities, the school nurtures well-rounded individuals who are physically active,
          mentally sharp, and emotionally balanced.
