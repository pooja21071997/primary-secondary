    The school campus offers a learner-friendly environment with a fine blend of functionality and
    aesthetics. From its firm foundation, the school building soars to an eight-storeyed vertical
    structure, symbolising an educational setting that enables students to rise to greater heights.
    CCTV surveillance system, wide corridors and stairwells, fire prevention system, and deployment
    of security personnel are among the several safety and security measures taken by the School to
    ensure a safe campus environment. All facilities in the school are IT-enabled, with a provision
    for broadband connectivity and conducting virtual classes.
