        <p class="fs-6 text-secondary lh-lg">
          Vivekanand Pratishthan Sanchalit Primary & Higher Primary School, established in June
          2016, serves as a beacon of educational excellence from Nursery to 10th standard. It
          stands as a testament to the visionary initiative of the Vivekanand Pratishthan
          Foundation, dedicated to shaping young minds through an amalgamation of traditional Indian
          knowledge systems and modern technological advancements. Our primary aim is to democratize
          education, providing every child with equitable access to learning opportunities
          regardless of their background.
        </p>

        <p class="fs-6 text-secondary lh-lg">
          At the heart of our educational philosophy lies the belief in value-added education. We
          don't just impart academic knowledge; we foster holistic development by nurturing
          creativity, compassion, and innovation in our students. Through a dynamic curriculum that
          integrates both theoretical understanding and practical application, we aim to instill in
          our students a deep appreciation for their cultural heritage while equipping them with the
          skills needed to thrive in the digital age.
        </p>

        <p class="fs-6 text-secondary lh-lg">
          Central to our mission is the active involvement of parents in their child’s educational
          journey. We recognize the crucial role parents play as partners in education, and thus, we
          ensure they are provided with the necessary tools and resources to remain engaged and
          supportive. Through regular communication channels, parent-teacher collaborations, and
          workshops, we create a cohesive community where everyone is invested in the success and
          well-being of our students. Together, we strive to create a nurturing environment where
          every child can reach their full potential and become responsible global citizens.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vivekanand Pratishthan is a
            sacred center in the field of education. We extend a heartfelt welcome to all parents.
            The foundation of a child's physical, mental, and social development is laid during
            early childhood, that is, from birth to six years of age. During this period, 70% of
            mental development and 40% of physical development takes place. How a child will lead
            life in the future largely depends on the family environment. Therefore the atmosphere
            at home should be supportive and nurturing for a child's proper development. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
            short, if the foundation of a child's development during early childhood is strong, a
            balanced personality will be formed. Hence, do not rush to make children grow up by
            taking away their childhood. Avoid saying that you do not have time for your own child.
            Instead, provide your child with nutritious food, love, care, protection and quality
            time, and have faith in them - everything will fall into place naturally.<br><br>
